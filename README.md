## Description
  This is a readme for my Challenge 12 assignment for my Vanderbilt University bootcamp. The Purpose of this Challenge is to introduce me to MVC, handlebars,and more server side code.

## Installation
  To install this application copy the code from my github, create a .env file with all the required env variables, install all required dependencies, create the database in the schema file located in the db folder, seed the database with the seed command in the package.json and last run the program with the start command.

## Usage
  Once you have sucessfully ran the program the first api endpoint will take you to the application hompage where you can view blog posts from exisiting users. In order to hit any other route, you will need to create a account. once you have created a account, you will have  all access to posting, deleting and updating features of the application.
